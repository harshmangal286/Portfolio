    <h1>Top 5 Web Development Trends in 2024</h1>
    
    <h2>1. AI-Powered Websites</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing web development by enabling websites to offer personalized experiences. AI-powered chatbots, recommendation systems, and dynamic content adjustment based on user preferences are becoming standard. For example, e-commerce platforms are leveraging AI to suggest products tailored to a user’s past behavior. The integration of AI also boosts website automation, ensuring smoother operations.</p>

    <h2>2. Serverless Architecture</h2>
    <p>Serverless computing is transforming how developers approach infrastructure. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions allow developers to run code without managing servers. This trend reduces costs, improves scalability, and shortens development cycles. Businesses are adopting serverless architecture for real-time data processing, backend services, and API-driven applications.</p>

    <h2>3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h2>
    <p>Progressive Web Apps combine the best features of web and mobile applications. They offer offline functionality, fast loading speeds, and app-like user interfaces. Companies like Twitter and Pinterest have already adopted PWAs to improve user engagement and performance. In 2024, we can expect more businesses to embrace this technology to enhance accessibility and usability across devices.</p>

    <h2>4. WebAssembly</h2>
    <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is a game-changer for web development, allowing developers to build high-performance applications directly in the browser. Applications like video editors, 3D games, and simulation tools, which were previously limited to desktop software, are now moving to the web. With WebAssembly, developers can write code in multiple languages like C++ or Rust and run it efficiently on the web.</p>

    <h2>5. Dark Mode</h2>
    <p>Dark mode continues to dominate web design trends due to its aesthetic appeal and practical benefits. It reduces eye strain, saves battery life on OLED devices, and enhances readability in low-light environments. Many popular websites and applications now offer a toggle for light and dark modes, making it an essential feature for modern web design.</p>
    
    <p>As the web evolves, staying updated with these trends is crucial for developers and businesses alike. Embracing these technologies and design philosophies ensures websites remain competitive and deliver exceptional user experiences.</p>
